Description: universal execution engine for distributed computation
 CIEL is designed to achieve high scalability and reliability when run on a
 commodity cluster or cloud computing platform. CIEL supports the full range
 of MapReduce-style computations, as well as Turing-powerful support for 
 iterative and dynamic programming. The included Skywriting scripting language
 allows developers to create more sophisticated algorithms using a JavaScript-like
 syntax, and bindings are available for other languages such as Java, Scala,
 Python or OCaml.
